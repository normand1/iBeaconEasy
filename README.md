EventPing
===========

Event Ping is an app for easily sharing what you're doing at any event (like a hackathon). 
All you need is the EventPing App and an ibeacon. You can get started with iBeacon instantly 
by just entering your iBeacon details and a message you'd like to share to everyone! 
Share fast, easily and simply in real life!
